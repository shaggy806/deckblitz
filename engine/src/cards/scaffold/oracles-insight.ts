// Rulings:
//   [2013-09-15] You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and
//     abilities, that means you’ll scry last. For others, that means you’ll scry and then perform
//     other actions.
//   [2013-09-15] You choose how to order cards returned to your library after scrying no matter
//     where you put them.
//   [2013-09-15] When you scry, you may put all the cards you look at back on top of your library,
//     you may put all of those cards on the bottom of your library, or you may put some of those
//     cards on top and the rest of them on the bottom.
//   [2013-09-15] Scry appears on some spells and abilities with one or more targets. If all of the
//     spell or ability’s targets are illegal when it tries to resolve, it won’t resolve and none
//     of its effects will happen. You won’t scry.
